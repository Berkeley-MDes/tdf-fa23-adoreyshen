# Week 1 Report - Week of 08/31/2023
## Technology Design Foundations  


### Intro & summary

This week, I explored Rhino and Grasshopper to make a little change on the existing phone stand design. I also laser cutted the tweaked version of the phone stand.
The progress photos from this week are shown below! 


### Progress description

I first measured my phone's dimension (with my phone case on), since my case is a pretty standard one, it doesn't require much changing in width and thickness.
So my tweaked design's dimensions are:

width: 76mm
length: 165mm
thickness: 11mm



Then I input all those data into the Grasshopper file

I picked 1/4" plywood as material since it's cheap (ðŸ«¢) and five people shared one board!


Here's how it looks!

Work on your weekly Progress Report
please include images of attempts to tweak file, & images of laser cut objects (if you are successful)
reflect on the experience of exploring a procedural model whose output is a cell phone stand design in Rhino
Consider: What other contextual observations would be useful to capture?
Consider: What other evaluations of results would be useful to provide as feedback?
Consider: Are there points in the process where you think AIâ€¦
Could be used to assist?
Could be trained on input and output?
Other?

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
