# Week 1 Report - Week of 08/31/2023
## Technology Design Foundations  


### Intro & summary

This week, I explored Rhino and Grasshopper to make a little change on the existing phone stand design. I also laser cutted the tweaked version of the phone stand.
The progress photos from this week are shown below!     





### Progress description

I first measured my phone's dimension (with my phone case on), since my case is a pretty standard one, it doesn't require much changing in width and thickness.
So my tweaked design's dimensions are:

width: 76mm  
length: 165mm  
thickness: 11mm  



  
Then I input all those data into the Grasshopper file

After baking and export the file into AI, I just followed the instructions to change the color and path thickness in AI. Then for laser cutting, I picked 1/4" plywood as material since it's cheap (ðŸ«¢) and five people shared one board!


Here's how it looks!

### Reflection

This is my first time using Grasshopper and even I used Rhino (a little bit) before, the whole process seems quite overwhelming to me ðŸ«¨
The flow map in Grasshopper is massive and I only got to explore the few parameters that I am sure of.

However, I do believe this procedural model can be really powerful when we are trying to model a CAD in the context of many external factors. Instead of tweaking the specific dimensions manually in the CAD, this method helps a lot to save time for iterations under different scenarios. Moreover, its 'adaptive' function and Rhino's way of showing everything together definitely makes the connection of every factors more visually intuitive to understand.


Some of my considerations:

1. What other contextual observations would be useful to capture?  

  

It can be the distance and angle between the center of the screen to the focus point of the user's view. Also maybe the estimated using time since longer using time may cause posture change of user. It can also relates to the height of the user's chair (or the height extending from the table depending on user's height)


2. What other evaluations of results would be useful to provide as feedback?  


It can be subjective like how fatigue the user feels after using the setup.

3. Are there points in the process where you think AIâ€¦
   Could be used to assist? & Could be trained on input and output?  


   
   AI can definitely be combined with this process to make the iterative progress more smart. A direct feedback loop can be set up and AI can iterate within the range till it hits the 'sweet spot' range set up by the user. It can be further trained to suggest a more reasonable input and therefore generate a more accurate output.
